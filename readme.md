# Spark Intrusion Detection
This project uses Spark to analyze a network intrusion dataset. I specifically want to use PySpark with anomaly detection and clustering techniques to successfully classify network traffic as normal or anomalous.

# Data Background
Here is the official description of this dataset: https://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/task.html

This is a **classification** dataset with labeled 'normal' and 'anomalous' classes. Each class and observation is independent from one another. The dataset is TCP/IP dump data for a simulated US Air Force LAN and details various aspects of each connection, including duration, protocol, and more.

This dataset has been made available here: (https://www.kaggle.com/galaxyh/kdd-cup-1999-data)
